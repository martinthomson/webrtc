      An API is described for sourcing and terminating streams of realtime media in a browser.  The API provides a means of describing how media streams are serialized into a stream of RTP packets or deserialized from a stream of packets.
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Realtime communications between browsers depends on the packetization of media.  This API provides a way to control how media streams are turned into packets and how those packets are turned into media streams.
      </p>
      <p>
        Interoperable realtime media between browsers uses RTP [[!I-D.rtcweb-rtp-usage]].  RTP depends on the existence of a signaling channel to establish a common understanding of the meaning of packets.  This includes identification of different streams, codecs, and codec parameters.
      </p>
      <p>
        An RTP session consists of a series of RTP streams.  Each stream has a source and one or more sinks.  This API provides objects that directly map to RTP streams.  The source and sink of each realtime media stream is a <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> [[!mediacapture-streams]].  This allows applications to build more complex arrangements of streams, composing them into aggregate <code>MediaStream</code> collections.
      </p>
      <p>
        Exchanging media in real time between browsers requires the use of a real time media transport, such as is described in RealtimeTransport [[!realtime-transport]].
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The exchange of realtime media between two browsers follows the process:
        <ol>
          <li>
            At the media source, input devices are opened for capture.
          </li>
          <li>
            Media from the input devices is encoded into packets that are transmitted across the network.
            </li>
          <li>
            At the media destination, the packets are decoded and formed into a media stream.
          </li>
          <li>
            The media stream is sent to output devices.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        Local capture and playback of media (steps 1. and 4.) can be achieved by the media capture API [[!mediacapture-streams]].  The realtime media streaming API provides access to functions that allow for the transmission of media stream across a network between these two points.
      </p>
      <img src="overview.png" alt="Image showing overview of realtime media" title="Overview of Realtime Media" />
      <p>
        The basic primitive of this API, the <code><a>RealtimeMediaStream</a></code> is a single, unidirectional stream of media.  This basic unit can be used to assemble more complex communications scenarios.  For example, an application that wishes to enable two-way audio and video communications between peers can create four such streams: an audio stream in each direction, plus a video stream in each direction.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to transmit a track from a local media stream&mdash;audio or video&mdash;an application takes the track and a <code>RealtimeTransport</code> [[!rt-transport]] and creates a <code><a>RealtimeMediaStream</a></code>.  A <code><a>RealtimeMediaDescription</a></code> is used to describe how the track is encoded.
      </p>
      <pre class="example">
navigator.getUserMedia({ audio: true }, function(media) {
    var track = media.audioTracks[0];
    var description = new RealtimeMediaDescription(track);
    var localRtStream = new LocalRealtimeMediaStream(track, description, realtimeTransport);
    signalingChannel.send(description.toDictionary());
});
      </pre>
      <p>
        In order to receive the same stream, the <code><a>RealtimeMediaDescription</a></code> is signaled between the two peers.  This description can be used to create a <code><a>RealtimeMediaStream</a></code> that decodes encoded tracks.
      </p>
      <pre class="example">
function receiveDescriptionFromSignaling(remoteDescription) {
    var description = new RealtimeMediaDescription(remoteDescription);
    var remoteRtStream = description.createStream(realtimeTransport);
    var remoteMedia = new MediaStream(remoteRtStream.track);
    outputTag.src = URL.createObjectURL(remoteMedia);
});
      </pre>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The RealtimeMediaStream Object</h2>
      <p>
        A <code>RealtimeMediaStream</code> represents a uni-directional flow of media to or from the browser.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instances of <code>RealtimeMediaStream</code> are created through type-specific constructors, either <code><a>LocalRealtimeMediaStream</a></code> or <code><a>RemoteRealtimeMediaStream</a></code>.  Each MUST be created for a single type of stream; audio and video cannot be mixed in a single stream.
      </p>
      <p>
        Synchronization of streams is achieved by having audio and video tracks added to the same <code>MediaStream</code> so that packet timestamps and playback can be properly matched between the streams.
      </p>
      <dl title="[NoInterfaceObject] interface RealtimeMediaStream : EventTarget" class="idl">
        <dt>readonly attribute MediaStreamTrack track</dt>
        <dd>
          The media track that is either being consumed or produced by this realtime media stream.
        </dd>
        <dt>readonly attribute RealtimeTransport transport</dt>

        </dd>
        <dt>void updateDescription(RealtimeMediaDescription description)</dt>
        <dd>
          Change the description that is being used for the stream atomically.
        </dd>
        <dt>void updateTransport(RealtimeTransport transport, optional RealtimeTransport rtcpTransport)</dt>
        <dd>
          Change the underlying transport that is being used for the stream.  Optionally, set a different transport for the RTCP feedback for the stream.  If the <code>rtcpTransport</code> parameter is omitted or the same as the <code>transport</code>, then RTCP multiplexing with RTP [[!RFC5761]] is used.

        <h3>The <code>LocalRealtimeMediaStream</code> Object</h3>
        <p>
          The <code>LocalRealtimeMediaStream</code> represents a locally-sourced stream of realtime media.

        <p>
          The constructor for <code>LocalRealtimeMediaStream</code> ignores any information in the <code>RealtimeMediaDescription</code> that it is passed that is not applicable to the provided track.

        <h3>The <code>RemoteRealtimeMediaStream</code> Object</h3>
        <p>
          A <code>RemoteRealtimeMediaStream</code> represents a stream of realtime media that originates on the network.
        </p>
        <p>
          The constructor to <code>RemoteRealtimeMediaStream</code> constructs a <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> based on the provided <code>RealtimeMediaDescription</code>.  If the browser is unable to construct this object, then an error is thrown.  This error might be thrown if the media description includes information for both audio and video tracks.

            Called when an <a href="#unknownpackettype">unknown packet type</a> arrives on the stream.

        <section id="unknownpackettype">
          <h4>Dealing with Mismatched Media Descriptions</h4>
          <p>
            Some errors in media descriptions cannot be immediately detected by the browser.  Descriptions that contain unsupported or conflicting features can be readily detected.  Other errors are not obvious until incompatible media arrives.
          </p>
          <p>
            One such error arises for an incoming stream when an RTP packet type is not assigned to a codec. In this case, the first instance of an RTP packet arriving with an unknown packet type triggers an <code>UnknownPacketTypeEvent</code> to be fired.  After the first instance of this event, packets marked with the unknown packet type are ignored.
          </p>
          <p>
            Updating the <code><a>RealtimeMediaDescription</a></code> on a stream resets the event status of any existing unknown packet types.  When another packet containing an unknown packet type arrives, the event is fired once more.

      <h2>The <code>RealtimeMediaDescription</code> Object</h2>
      <p>
        A <code>RealtimeMediaDescription</code> is the basic means of specifying what a packetized stream of media looks like.  A <code>RealtimeMediaDescription</code> is used to specify what an outgoing stream is to look like and to describe what an incoming stream looks like.
      </p>
      <p>
        Specific sub-classes are used for describing outbound and inbound streams, though the basic parameters are common.

This can be used as a basis for negotiating a common set of capabilities between peers.  This throws an <code>Error</code> if the resulting description cannot possibly be used to describe any realtime stream because the constraints are incompatible with the current state of the description.

          <dt>unsigned long clockRate</dt>
          <dd>
            The clock rate for this codec description, specified in Hertz.
          </dd>
          <dt>boolean silenceSuppression = true</dt>
          <dd>
            For audio codecs that support silence suppression, this value determines if the codec is permitted to perform silence suppression.
          </dd>
          <dt>DOMString fmtp</dt>
          <dd>
            Format-specific parameters for the codec, taken from the SDP definition for the codec.

        <h3>The <code>RealtimeMediaDescriptionConstraints</code> Object</h3>
        <p>
          The constraints structure is defined in [[!GETUSERMEDIA]].  <code><dfn>RealtimeMediaDescriptionConstraints</dfn></code> uses this scheme with a different set of possible constraints.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following constraints are defined:
        </p>
        
        <dl>
          <dt>rtcp</dt>
          <dd>
            A set of RTCP features (in an array) that contains all the features that are permitted and desired.  This constraint can be met if the RTCP features on all streams are exactly the provided set.
          </dd>
          <dt>silenceSuppression</dt>
          <dd>
            A <code>boolean</code> value that determines the value for the <code>silenceSuppression</code> parameter of the <code><a>CodecDescription</a></code>.
          </dd>
          <dt>bandwidth</dt>
          <dd>
            An <code>unsigned long</code> value for the overall bandwidth allocated to the stream (or set of streams).
          </dd>
        </dl>
