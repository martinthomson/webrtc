        An API is described for sourcing and terminating streams of real-time media in a browser.  The API provides a means of describing how media streams are serialized into a stream of RTP packets or deserialized from a stream of packets.
      </p>
      <p>
        The API is structed in two sections: Real-Time Media Streaming and Real-Time, Peer-to-Peer Transport.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Thanks in no small part to the exponential improvements in Web infrastructure over the last few years, it is now possible to leverage the digital backbone of the Internet to create experiences for which dedicated media and networks (cable TV, telephone) were necessary until not too long ago. Furthermore, these developments have enabled the creation of media experiences heretofore either plainly inaccessible or too impractical for most. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Inexpensive, real time video conferencing is one such experience. It has grown enormously in popularity and it is now a daily component of many peopleâ€™s lives, bringing together families and friends, and making business easier all over the world. 
      </p>
      <p>
        But there are other applications of the same general technology, which are also experiencing substantial growth. Online gaming requires the real time exchange of data across geographically dispersed computers, and so do certain business critical applications like those that govern the functioning of financial markets. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The Internet Engineering Task Force and the World Wide Web Council have recently created complementary working groups to bring these powerful capabilities to the most familiar and widespread application used to experience the Internet: the web browser. The goal of this initiative is to add a new level of interactivity for web users with real-time communications (Web RTC) in the browser. 
      </p>
      <p>
        While the overarching goal is simple to describe, there are several critical requirements that a successful, widely adoptable Web RTC API will need to meet: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Customizable response to changing network quality</strong>&mdash;Real time media applications have to run on networks with a wide range of capabilities varying in terms of bandwidth, latency, and noise. Likewise these characteristics can change while an application is running. Developers should be able to control how the user experience adapts to fluctuations in communication quality. For example, when communication quality degrades, the developer may prefer to favor the video channel, favor the audio channel, or suspend the app until acceptable quality is restored. An effective protocol and API will have to arm developers with the tools to tailor such answers to the exact needs of the moment, while minimizing the complexity of the resulting API surface. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ubiquitous deployability on the existing network infrastructure</strong>&mdash;Interoperability is critical if WebRTC users must be able to communicate with the rest of the world, with users on different browsers, VoIP phones, and mobile phones, from behind firewalls and across routers and equipment that is unlikely to be upgraded to the current state of the art anytime soon. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Flexibility in its support of popular media formats and codecs as well as openness to future innovation</strong>&mdash;A successful standard cannot be tied to individual codecs, data formats or scenarios. They may soon be supplanted by newer versions, which would make such a tightly coupled standard obsolete just as quickly. The right approach is instead to bring the bulk of the logic to the application layer, enabling dDevelopers to innovate. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Honoring key Web tenets</strong>&mdash;The Web favors stateless interactions which do not saddle either party of a data exchange with the responsibility to remember what the other did or expects. Doing otherwise is a recipe for extreme brittleness in implementations; it also raises considerably the development cost which reduces the reach of the standard itself. 
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    
    <section id="media">
      <h2>Real-Time Media Streaming</h2>
      <p>
        Real-Time communications between browsers depends on the packetization of media.  This API provides a way to control how media streams are turned into packets and how those packets are turned into media streams.
      </p>
      <p>
        Interoperable real-time media between browsers uses RTP [[!I-D.rtcweb-rtp-usage]].  RTP depends on the existence of a signaling channel to establish a common understanding of the meaning of packets.  This includes identification of different streams, codecs, and codec parameters.
      </p>
      <p>
        An RTP session consists of a series of RTP streams.  Each stream has a source and one or more sinks.  This API provides objects that directly map to RTP streams.  The source and sink of each real-time media stream is a <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> [[!GETUSERMEDIA]].  This allows applications to build more complex arrangements of streams, composing them into aggregate <code>MediaStream</code> collections.
      </p>
      <p>
        Exchanging media in real time between browsers requires the use of a real time media transport, such as is described in <a href="#transport" class="sectionRef"></a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The exchange of real-time media between two browsers follows the process:
        <ol>
          <li>
            At the media source, input devices are opened for capture.
          </li>
          <li>
            Media from the input devices is encoded into packets that are transmitted across the network.
            </li>
          <li>
            At the media destination, the packets are decoded and formed into a media stream.
          </li>
          <li>
            The media stream is sent to output devices.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        Local capture and playback of media (steps 1. and 4.) can be achieved by the media capture API [[!GETUSERMEDIA]].  The real-time media streaming API provides access to functions that allow for the transmission of media stream across a network between these two points.
      </p>
      <img src="overview.png" alt="Image showing overview of real-time media" title="Overview of Real-Time Media" />
      <p>
        The basic primitive of this API, the <code><a>RealtimeMediaStream</a></code> is a single, unidirectional stream of media.  This basic unit can be used to assemble more complex communications scenarios.  For example, an application that wishes to enable two-way audio and video communications between peers can create four such streams: an audio stream in each direction, plus a video stream in each direction.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to transmit a track from a local media stream&mdash;audio or video&mdash;an application takes the track and a <code><a>RealtimeTransport</a></code> and creates a <code><a>RealtimeMediaStream</a></code>.  A <code><a>RealtimeMediaDescription</a></code> is used to describe how the track is encoded.
      </p>
      <pre class="example">
navigator.getUserMedia({ audio: true }, function(media) {
    var track = media.audioTracks[0];
    var description = new RealtimeMediaDescription(track);
    var localRtStream = new LocalRealtimeMediaStream(track, description, realtimeTransport);
    signalingChannel.send(description.toDictionary());
});
      </pre>
      <p>
        In order to receive the same stream, the <code><a>RealtimeMediaDescription</a></code> is signaled between the two peers.  This description can be used to create a <code><a>RealtimeMediaStream</a></code> that decodes encoded tracks.
      </p>
      <pre class="example">
function receiveDescriptionFromSignaling(remoteDescription) {
    var description = new RealtimeMediaDescription(remoteDescription);
    var remoteRtStream = description.createStream(realtimeTransport);
    var remoteMedia = new MediaStream(remoteRtStream.track);
    outputTag.src = URL.createObjectURL(remoteMedia);
});
      </pre>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The RealtimeMediaStream Object</h2>
      <p>
        A <code>RealtimeMediaStream</code> represents a uni-directional flow of media to or from the browser.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instances of <code>RealtimeMediaStream</code> are created through type-specific constructors, either <code><a>LocalRealtimeMediaStream</a></code> or <code><a>RemoteRealtimeMediaStream</a></code>.  Each MUST be created for a single type of stream; audio and video cannot be mixed in a single stream.
      </p>
      <p>
        Synchronization of streams is achieved by having audio and video tracks added to the same <code>MediaStream</code> so that packet timestamps and playback can be properly matched between the streams.
      </p>
      <dl title="[NoInterfaceObject] interface RealtimeMediaStream : EventTarget" class="idl">
        <dt>readonly attribute MediaStreamTrack track</dt>
        <dd>

        </dd>
        <dt>void updateTransport(RealtimeTransport transport, optional RealtimeTransport rtcpTransport)</dt>
        <dd>
          Change the underlying transport that is being used for the stream.  Optionally, set a different transport for the RTCP feedback for the stream.  If the <code>rtcpTransport</code> parameter is omitted or the same as the <code>transport</code>, then RTCP multiplexing with RTP [[!RFC5761]] is used.
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <section>
        <h3>The <code>LocalRealtimeMediaStream</code> Object</h3>
        <p>
          The <code>LocalRealtimeMediaStream</code> represents a locally-sourced stream of real-time media.
        </p>
        <p>
          The constructor for <code>LocalRealtimeMediaStream</code> ignores any information in the <code>RealtimeMediaDescription</code> that it is passed that is not applicable to the provided track.

        <h3>The <code>RemoteRealtimeMediaStream</code> Object</h3>
        <p>
          A <code>RemoteRealtimeMediaStream</code> represents a stream of real-time media that originates on the network.
        </p>
        <p>
          The constructor to <code>RemoteRealtimeMediaStream</code> constructs a <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> based on the provided <code>RealtimeMediaDescription</code>.  If the browser is unable to construct this object, then an error is thrown.  This error might be thrown if the media description includes information for both audio and video tracks.
        </p>
        <dl title="[Constructor(RealtimeMediaDescription description, RealtimeTransport transport, optional RealtimeTransport rtcpTransport)] interface RemoteRealtimeMediaStream : RealtimeMediaStream" class="idl">
          <dt>attribute UnknownPacketTypeEventHandler? onunknownpackettype</dt>
          <dd>
            Called when an <a href="#unknownpackettype">unknown packet type</a> arrives on the stream.
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <section id="unknownpackettype">
          <h4>Dealing with Mismatched Media Descriptions</h4>
          <p>
            Some errors in media descriptions cannot be immediately detected by the browser.  Descriptions that contain unsupported or conflicting features can be readily detected.  Other errors are not obvious until incompatible media arrives.
          </p>
          <p>
            One such error arises for an incoming stream when an RTP packet type is not assigned to a codec. In this case, the first instance of an RTP packet arriving with an unknown packet type triggers an <code>UnknownPacketTypeEvent</code> to be fired.  After the first instance of this event, packets marked with the unknown packet type are ignored.
          </p>
          <p>
            Updating the <code><a>RealtimeMediaDescription</a></code> on a stream resets the event status of any existing unknown packet types.  When another packet containing an unknown packet type arrives, the event is fired once more.

      <h2>The <code>RealtimeMediaDescription</code> Object</h2>
      <p>
        A <code>RealtimeMediaDescription</code> is the basic means of specifying what a packetized stream of media looks like.  A <code>RealtimeMediaDescription</code> is used to specify what an outgoing stream is to look like and to describe what an incoming stream looks like.
      </p>
      <p>
        Specific sub-classes are used for describing outbound and inbound streams, though the basic parameters are common.

          Update the description to include only those settings that are specified in the provided dictionary.  This can be used as a basis for negotiating a common set of capabilities between peers.  This throws an <code>Error</code> if the resulting description cannot possibly be used to describe any real-time stream because the constraints are incompatible with the current state of the description.

        This document describes how transport flows can be created in a browser. A transport flow is a construct that allows for bidirectional exchange of UDP packets. Chances are, these transport flows will be established between browsers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The flow of packets is encrypted and&mdash;depending on the selected protocol&mdash;the browser is able to ensure that the recipient is willing to receive the flow. Setup is mediated by the web application.

      <h2>Real-Time Transport</h2>
      <p>
        Establishing flows of real-time media to and from browsers requires a transport that is suited to this purpose.  This document describes how real-time transport flows can be created in a browser. A real-time transport flow is a construct that allows for bidirectional exchange of UDP packets.
      </p>
      <p>
        UDP and RTP [[!RFC3550]] provide the means for the delivery of time-sensitive media between peers.  This channel is secured using SRTP [[!RFC3711]] with key negotiation in signaling or through DTLS.
      </p>
      <p>Establishing flows of UDP through middleboxes such as Network Address Translators (NAT) or firewalls requires the use of techniques such as Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) [[!RFC5245]].  The provided API describes primitives that enable the implementation of ICE, but do not require it other than requiring the consent mechanisms that it provides, which is critical to the security of the web.
      </p>
      <p>
        This API only deals with the creation of a secured transport between peers.  Sending media using this API is described in another document.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Design Goals</h3>
        <p>
          It is possible to achieve the basic goals in a number of ways.  This design attempts to provide the maximum flexibility in the API, with minimal complexity.
        </p>
        <p>
          To that end, the API ensures that the browser contains as little of the implementation of the transport establishment code as possible.  This provides the using application more control over application logic.
        </p>
        <p>
          This API also reduces the amount of application state that the browser maintains.  This reduces the coupling of browser and application implementations, simplifies API interactions, gives applications greater control over browser behavior and enables the creation of more robust applications.  For example, a browser with less accumulated state can recover necessary state faster in the event of a reload than otherwise.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Non-Goals</h3>
        <p>
          It is not a goal of this API to provide an application with the ability to create minimal realtme applications.  Browser APIs rarely change once deployed, which means that a constraint imposed by an API is difficult to remove.  In complete contrast, applications on the web are able to evolve rapidly.  Moving the bulk of the necessary logic to application code ensures greater scope for innovation.  A simple set of basic primitives are better enablers.
        </p>

        <p>
          The successful creation of RTP streams requires signaling.  Subjecting that signaling to standardization would constrain how it manifests, limiting the flexibility of applications that use these APIs.
        </p>
      </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Real-Time Transport Usage</h3>
      <p>
        Establishing real-time media transport requires the interaction of two objects:
        <ul>
          <li>
            The <code><a>RealtimePort</a></code> is the end point for a real-time transport.  This represents a UDP port, opened by the browser.  The RealtimePort encapsulates the functions necessary to perform an ICE negotiation [[!RFC5245]].  In ICE terms, a <code><a>RealtimePort</a></code> is a local candidate.
          </li>
          <li>
            The <code><a>RealtimeTransport</a></code> is a peer-to-peer bearer for secured media.  It binds a local <code><a>RealtimePort</a></code> to a remote <code><a>RealtimePort</a></code> and enables the bidirectional exchange of media packets.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to establish a transport between a local peer and remote peer, the following process is applied:
        <ol>
          <li>
            The local peer opens one or more real-time ports.
          </li>
          <li>
            The local peer then has to learn of the ports that its remote peer has opened.  This uses a signaling channel specific to the application.  For instance, a web application could use previously HTTP requests or Websockets connections for this purpose.
          </li>
          <li>
            A process of discovery is used to find a local and remote port pair (a candidate pair) that can exchange UDP packets.  One or more connectivity checks are made from different local ports toward different remote ports.  A successful connectivity check indicates that packets can reach the peer and that the peer consents to receive packets.  
          </li>
          <li>
            Finally, a real-time transport is established on the pair of ports.  A security context is established so that secured media packets are able to flow in both directions between peers.  Real-Time media streams can then be added to the transport.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        In the first step of this scenario one or more <code><a>RealtimePort</a></code> objects are created in different ways.  The browser allocates a local UDP port on each of the available network interfaces and returns these to the application.
      </p>
      <pre class="example">
    RealtimePort.openLocalPorts(function(ports) {
        signalingChannel.send('candidates', ports);
        localCandidates.push(ports);
    });
      </pre>
      <p>
        Each real-time port consists of an IP address, a port number, a username fragment and password.  This information is exchanged with the remote peer using whatever signaling mechanism is chosen by the application.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other forms of real-time port might be necessary for successful traversal of middleboxes like firewalls and NATs.  For instance, a relay port (i.e., relay candidate) uses a relay server to forward packets.  Because the relay server is publically reachable, many of the concerns with middlebox traversal do not apply to it, enabling communication in more challenging network conditions.
      </p>
      <pre class="example">
    RealtimePort.allocateRelay(relay, function(error, relayCandidates) {
        if (!error) {
            signalingChannel.send('candidate', relayCandidate);
        }
    });
      </pre>
      <p>
        Local and remote real-time ports are paired and connectivity checking is used for each pair to determine which ports can be used for exchanging packets.
      </p>
      <pre class="example">
    function receivePeerCandidates(remotePorts) {
        var candidatePairs = localCandidates.forEach(function(local) {
            return remotePorts.forEach(function(remote) {
                local.check(remote, checkCallback(local, remote));
            });
        });
    }
      </pre>
      <p>
        Of the successful connectivity checks, one or more pairs are selected.  A <code><a>RealtimeTransport</a></code> is then created from the pair of ports.
      </p>
      <pre class="example">
    function connectivityCheckSuccess(local, remote) {
        RealtimeTransport.createTransport(local, remote, options, function(err, transport) {
            realtimeTransport = transport;
        });
    }
      </pre>
      <p>
        The resulting transport object can be used to securely exchange media with the peer.

            The <code><dfn>RealtimePortCallback</dfn></code> callback function is passed to <code><a>openLocalPorts</a></code> or <code><a>allocateRelay</a></code>.   When the port is either successfully opened, or opening fails, the callback is invoked.  Opening local ports cannot fail.  Allocating a TURN relay port creates a single port.

          <h4>Opening Local Ports</h4>
          <p>
            Host-local ports (host candidates in ICE) are UDP ports that are opened on the local host.  These ports are opened by the browser in response to a call to <code><a>RealtimePort</a>.<a href="#widl-RealtimePort-openLocalPorts">openLocalPorts</a>(<var>callback</var>)</code>.
          </p>

          <p class="note">
            The username fragment and password used in ICE is normally global.  That is, the same values are shared for all candidates in the same session.  Browsers that wish to interoperate with non-browser peers SHOULD provide the same value for ufrag and pwd as a result of each request to open local ports.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h4>Discovering Server Reflexive Addresses</h4>
          <p>
            A <dfn>server reflexive address</dfn> is the addressing information for a given port, as seen by a server.  The server reports the address that it sees when the browser sends it a packet.  Where there are network address translation (NAT) middleboxes between the browser and the server, this reveals the translated address at the NAT, a value that might be undetectable from the browser.
          </p>
          <p>
            Server reflexive addresses are gathered by making connectivity checks to STUN servers from a specific local real-time port.  The server provides the address that it sees in the <code>XOR-MAPPED-ADDRESS</code> attribute of the response.
          </p>
          <p>Using a server reflexive address ultimately results in packets arriving at the corresponding host-local port.  Therefore, server reflexive addresses do not require the creation of additional <code><a>RealtimePort</a></code> objects in the browser.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <a href="#checking">connectivity check</a> interface is used to send queries to STUN servers.  When querying a STUN server, the <code><a>RemoteRealtimePort</a></code> can include several variations on the set of included options:
            <ul>
              <li>
                An ICE-compatible <a href="#checking">connectivity check</a> is invoked by providing ICE username fragment and password parameters.  The STUN <code>USERNAME</code> attribute is populated by concatenating the remote username fragment (<code><var>remotePort</var>.ufrag</code>), a colon character (':') and the local username fragment.  The <code>MESSAGE-INTEGRITY</code> attribute is created using the remote password (<code><var>remotePort</var>.pwd</code>) as described in [[!RFC5389]].
              </li>
              <li>
                A <var>username</var> parameter can be provided in place of <var>ufrag</var>.  The browser uses the value of <var>username</var> for the STUN <code>USERNAME</code> attribute.  <code>MESSAGE-INTEGRITY</code> is filled as normal.
              </li>
              <li>
                Both <var>ufrag</var> and <var>username</var> can be omitted to suppress the inclusion of the <code>USERNAME</code> attribute.
              </li>
              <li>
                <var>pwd</var> can be omitted to suppress the inclusion of the <code>MESSAGE-INTEGRITY</code> attribute.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            A port pair is only marked as having active consent if the ICE-compatible connectivity check is used.  This ensures that STUN servers cannot be bombarded with media from browsers.
          </p>
          <p>
            If long-term credentials are in use for the STUN server, as described in [[!RFC5389]], then the application is responsible for calculating the value of the password.

        <section id="allocateRelay">
          <h4>Allocating Relays</h4>
          <p>
            UDP relays are allocated by calling <code><a>RealtimePort</a>.<dfn>allocateRelay</dfn>(<var>turnServerRealtimePort</var>, <var>callback</var>[, <var>attributes</var>])</code>.  The browser performs a TURN [[!RFC5766]] relay allocation with the identified host and provides a relayed <code><a>RealtimePort</a></code> to the provided callback.
          </p>
          <p>
            A <var>turn</var> attribute can be set on the TURN server <code><a>RemoteRealtimePort</a></code> to select the transport used between the browser and TURN server.  The <var>turn</var> attribute takes one of three values: <code>udp</code>, <code>tcp</code>, or <code>tls</code>.  The browser uses UDP to communicate with the TURN server unless otherwise specified.  The <var>turn</var> attribute only determines the transport used between browser and TURN server; UDP is the only supported transport between the server and remote peers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once the allocation has completed, the <var>callback</var> method is invoked.  An error parameter is set to an error code if the allocation fails.  An array containing a single <code><a>RealtimePort</a></code> parameter is provided if the allocation is successful.
          </p>
          <pre class="example">
    function createRelayCandidate() {
        var relay = { ip: '192.0.2.75', port: 7754, username: 'user', password: 'password1', turn: 'udp' };
        RealtimePort.allocateRelay(relay, function(error, relayCandidates) {
            if (error) {
                reportError(error);
            } else {
                signalingChannel.send('candidate', relayCandidate);
                scheduleConnectivityChecks(relayCandidate);
            }
        });
    }
          </pre>
          <p>
            In order to select a specific local candidate for the allocation of relays, the <code><a>allocateRelay</a></code> method can be called on a candidate instance.  This is only possible if the transport to the relay server is UDP.
          </p>

          <h4>Closing Real-Time Ports</h4>
          <p>
            Real-Time ports can be closed by calling <code><a href="#widl-RealtimePort-close">close</a>()</code>.  This sets the <var>open</var> attribute to false and closes any transports that use the port.   Any attempt to invoke methods on a closed <code><a>RealtimePort</a></code> triggers an exception, except for <code>status(<var>remotePort</var>)</code> that can harmlessly return <code>false</code>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Closing a real-time port does not prevent packets from arriving, though it stops them from being seen by applications and thus connectivity checks to these ports fail.  A well-behaved remote peer will eventually stop sending when connectivity checks fail.
          </p>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Connectivity Checking</h3>
        <p>
          To establish a bidirectional transport flow between peers, both are required to successfully complete one or more connectivity check requests.  Connectivity checks are used to open ports on NAT and firewall middleboxes, to validate end-to-end connectivity and to establish that the peer is willing to receive packets.
        </p>

        <section id="checking">
          <h4>Sending Connectivity Checks</h4>
          <p>
            Applications can request the sending of a STUN Binding request to perform a connectivity check or collect additional addressing information.  The browser performs a connectivity check by sending a STUN Binding request using <code><var>candidate</var>.<a>check</a>(<var>remotePort</var>, <var>callback</var>[, <var>attributes</var>])</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The browser invokes the callback function if the connectivity check successfully completes.  The STUN request and response messages are passed to the callback.
          </p>
          <p>
            Binding requests MUST be globally rate limited by the browser.  Any requests that cannot be immediately sent are enqueued.  A browser MAY limit the number of requests that it will enqueue; lower limits SHOULD be applied to individual origins to prevent origins from monopolizing access to this feature.
          </p>
          <p class="note">
            ICE specifies a rate limiting function that is based on the expected bandwidth of media.  Since this depends on information provided by a potential web attacker, this input cannot be used.  The browser MUST rate limit connectivity checks based only on information that cannot be influenced or altered by a web attacker.
          </p>
          <p>
            The browser is responsible for populating the STUN <code>USERNAME</code>, <code>MESSAGE-INTEGRITY</code> and <code>FINGERPRINT</code> attributes.  STUN attributes can be added or overwritten by including values in the optional <code><var>attributes</var></code> parameter.  STUN attributes specified in this manner are covered by the integrity check.  Attributes that would cause the STUN request to exceed its size limit cause an exception to be thrown.
          </p>
          <p>
            DOMString values for <code><a href="#widl-RemoteRealtimePort-ufrag">ufrag</a></code> and <code><a href="#widl-RemoteRealtimePort-pwd">pwd</a></code> are encoded using UTF-8 [[!UTF-8]] in Binding requests.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prior to the successful completion of a connectivity check, the browser MUST NOT reveal the transaction identifier to the application.  Knowing the transaction identifier of a STUN request prior to receiving a successful response would enable the spoofing of responses, potentially tricking the browser into sending media packets to an unwilling recipient.
          </p>
          <p>
            The browser MUST limit the time that an outstanding connectivity check remains valid.  However, the browser is not responsible for providing a callback when this timer expires.  The application is responsible for looking after its own timers.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="tracking">
          <h4>Tracking Valid Real-Time Port Pairs</h4>
          <p>
            The browser is responsible for tracking valid remote real-time port pairs.  Any time that a locally originated connectivity check succeeds, the browser marks the pair of ports (local port + remote port) as valid.  The valid marking lasts for a fixed duration.  The browser SHOULD keep a port pair valid for 40 seconds.
          </p>
          <p>
            The browser MUST NOT send anything other than a connectivity check unless the port pair is valid.  This ensures that the remote peer has consented to receive packets and that the consent is recent.
          </p>
          <p>
            The status of a port pair can be queried by using <code><var>candidate</var>.<a>status</a>(<var>remotePort</var>)</code>.  This method returns <code>true</code> if a connectivity check between the two ports succeeded recently.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="serving">
          <h4>Responding to Connectivity Checks</h4>
          <p>
            The browser responds to valid connectivity checks on all open ports.  Received packets that do not conform with the following rules MUST be ignored:
            <ul>
              <li>
                The packet is a STUN Binding request that contains the STUN magic cookie [[!RFC5389]].
              </li>
              <li>
                The Binding request contains a <code>USERNAME</code> attribute that starts with the browser-assigned username fragment, plus a colon (ASCII 0x3a).
              </li>
              <li>
                The Binding request contains a valid <code>MESSAGE-INTEGRITY</code> attribute that is calculated over the <code>USERNAME</code> attribute.
              </li>
              <li>
                The Binding request contains a valid <code>FINGERPRINT</code> attribute.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            Applications can register a callback listener against a real-time port.  This function is called when a valid connectivity check is received.  The callback signature is identical to the callback for locally originated conectivity checks.  Both the request and response message are passed to the callback.
          </p>
          <p>
            Browsers respond to connectivity checks on each port that it opens.  The browser MUST limit the number of unique peers that it generates connectivity check responses for.  This ensures that the number of flows that can be created towards the browser from different browsers is limited.  This mitigates an attack where a web attacker shares open port information with multiple browsers.

        <h3>Network Interface Changes</h3>
        <p>
          Network interfaces are imperfect and impermanent.  They can change, appear and disappear with no warning, especially on mobile devices.  Reacting to changes in connectivity is a crucial part of providing good real-time transport.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <code><dfn>networkchange</dfn></code> event is registered against a local <code><a>RealtimePort</a></code>.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          Ideally, this would be globally registered, but since <code><a>RealtimePort</a></code> doesn't have a constructor, this might not be necessary.  Again, ideally this is something for the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/netinfo-api/">network information API</a> to solve.
        </p>
        <p>
          The browser fires a <code><a>networkchange</a></code> event when it detects a potential change in the status of the network.  Events that trigger this callback include changes to open network interfaces and the addition or removal of network interfaces.
        </p>

        <h3>Privacy Considerations</h3>
        <p>
          Applications that establish peer-to-peer transports require that the IP addresses of a peer are signaled to the remote peer.  This can pose a privacy exposure even though an IP address can only be loosely correlated with a person.  For instance, it is possible to use IP addresses to determine the physical location of a person.
        </p>
        <p>
          In some applications, establishing a peer-to-peer transport occurs prior to establishing user consent for the session.  This can be necessary to remove the delays associated with transport setup that might otherwise occur after session acceptance.  Exposing IP address information prior to acceptance provides the initiator of the session a way to collect the IP address of even an unwilling peer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Applications are encouraged to only signal relay ports prior to gaining explicit consent from users.

      <h2>Real-Time Transport</h2>
      
      <p>
        A <dfn>RealtimeTransport</dfn> represents the flow of packets between a local and a remote real-time port.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon creation, a <code><a>RealtimeTransport</a></code> beings automatically generating connectivity checks toward the selected remote peer.  If a consent check fails, the transport remains open, but no packets can be sent.

          <h4>Certificate Validation Callback</h4>
          <p>
            This callback method is invoked when a DTLS transport is being created.  It allows the application to block the creation of a new transport based on the identity of the peer.
          </p>
          <pre class="pseudoidl">

          </pre>
          <p>
            The callback is passed information about the certificate offered by the remote peer.  The application can make a decision based on this and either return <code>true</code> to indicate that the transport creation should proceed, or <code>false</code> to indicate that the transport creation should be aborted.

          <p>For example, an application might register the following <code>CertificateValidationCallback</code> to check that it is talking to the expected domain:
